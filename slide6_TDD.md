   ∙ Writing tests first no more remains only about testing. It 
     becomes about software development

   ∙ Test first creates better API because you start with the user 
     not the to be used code.

   ∙ Test first enforces design principles and hides implementation
     details and promotes the interface; overall accounts for better 
     written, more robust code.
