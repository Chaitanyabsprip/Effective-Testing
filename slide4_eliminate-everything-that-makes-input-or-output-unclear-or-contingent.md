                     Eliminate everything that makes input
                        or output unclear or contingent


   ∙ Never generate random input. Always use fixed values

   ∙ Don't use named constants from the production code
     Prefer literal strings and numbers 

   ∙ Don't access network or file system

   ∙ Try not to depend on quantities that change from system to system,
     for e.g.
       - character set
       - time zone
       - geographic location
       - language
       - default encoding
